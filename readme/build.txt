== building ==
Create git submodules (i.e. libraries)
> ./submodules
Build application (i.e. BATB)
> ./compile_it


== CMake info ==
* I suggest running cmake inside the build folder, in order to prevent pollution:
    > cd build/
    > cmake ..
    > make
* CMake variables can be defined in command line:
    > cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/path
