  =>  player movement easily controlled by WASD
  =>  player view easily controlled by mouse
  =>  manual control punching
        * it should be possible to be disqualified for incorrect controls :)
  =>  map handling easy and fast
        * automatic course-alignment on control punch.
          well, since we have manual punching, we must think more about this. 
          what if for example a player punches the correct one after the mistake?
          so maybe better to have a control for this. lets think about it.
        * automatic north-alignment on specific action (f.ex. double click)
  =>  running on trees will not slow down speed, only change run direction based on contact center
        * at least an option for this
        * different amount of direction change based on tree size? i.e. big amount on big tree.
  =>  very fast run speed possible, by controllable setting
        * training orienteering 
  =>  if stopping/slow down while running, again starting running will lose speed (i.e. needs (small) acceleration)
        * fast running and map reading should be rewarded
  =>  running into drinking controls/stations should be rewarded, with physical boost/better fatigue.
        * punch to drink.
