we use Turbobadger for GUI. 
* GUI should be usable by multiple Iteration's at the same frame, f.ex. 
  Run and Forest can have different GUI controls at the same time
* the GUI should be used for on-screen output of text, f.ex. FPS, ...
  in this way, we are able to extend this output later with more advanced
  stuff, f.ex. buttons, interactive output, ...
  GetRoot()->GetFont()->drawString( ...)
