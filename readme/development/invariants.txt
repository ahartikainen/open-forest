=== Invariants ===
These are invariants to be used in development.

== OpenGL ==
* development OpenGL substates (all other substates are the default substates for OpenGL):
  - ...
* if a function/class/etc. X modifies an OpenGL substate A, then the substate A shall be set 
  back to the development substate, when X is complete.
