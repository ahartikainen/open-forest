=== Invariants ===
These are invariants to be used in development.


== General ==
* for loading resources with Begin/End pairs, End shall be possible to call without Begin succeeded

== OpenGL ==
* development OpenGL substates (all other substates are the default substates for OpenGL):
  - ...
* if a function/class/etc. X modifies an OpenGL substate A, then the substate A shall be set 
  back to the development substate, when X is complete.

== Run ==
* Run shall set up OpenGL at each iteration, like setting framebuffer, etc. by OpenGL invariant above
  the full GL-state is known herefrom.
