  =>  player movement easily controlled by WASD
  =>  player view easily controlled by mouse
  =>  map handling easy and fast
        * automatic course-alignment on control punch
        * automatic north-alignment on double click?
  =>  running on trees will not slow down speed, only change run direction based on contact center
        * at least an option for this
        * different amount of direction change based on tree size? i.e. big amount on big tree.
  =>  very fast run speed possible, by setting
        * training orienteering 
  =>  if stopping/slow down while running, again starting running will lose speed (i.e. needs (small) acceleration)
        * fast running should be rewarded
