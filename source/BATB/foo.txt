 Notice: the following files contain runtime text relocations
 Text relocations force the dynamic linker to perform extra
 work at startup, waste system resources, and may pose a security
 risk.  On some architectures, the code may not even function
 properly, if at all.

QA Notice: the following files contain executable stacks
 Files with executable stacks will not work properly (or at all!)
 on some architectures/operating systems.  A bug should be filed
 at http://bugs.gentoo.org/ to make sure the file is fixed.
