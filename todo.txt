* run oldBATB from iterations, together with GLFW (Env)
* define RunWorldEvent's and ForestWorldEvent's. Since two worlds A and B of different types
  shall be mostly unaware of each other (at least the subworld unaware of superworld), iterations
  on A and B should create events for the respective worlds. then a superworld can look at the
  events for a subworld, in order to make actions.
* setting/values. changes during program? how reflected in config file?
* remove fixed pipeline rendering, use OpenGL 3.3/4.0+ (shaders and buffer objects)
* rename IterationRunDataXXX -> IterationRunXXX
