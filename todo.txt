* define RunWorldEvent's and ForestWorldEvent's. Since two worlds A and B of different types
  shall be mostly unaware of each other (at least the subworld unaware of superworld), iterations
  on A and B should create events for the respective worlds. then a superworld can look at the
  events for a subworld, in order to make actions.
* run oldBATB from iterations, together with GLFW (Env)
* (global) exception handling
* init Env from config file, init game from config file.
* create helpers (GL program creation, etc)
